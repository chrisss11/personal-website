            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Christopher Oh, or Chris for short. I’m a finance student at the University of Maryland with a strong interest in cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and finance. Currently, I’m exploring the intersection of digital innovation in crypto and financial markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey began in my freshman year when a friend showed me an NFT he bought. I remember thinking, "Why would anyone buy a picture online?" That night, I spent hours researching NFTs and eventually started trading them myself. From there, I dove into DeFi protocols, other blockchain networks, and fungible tokens. I made a lot, lost a lot, but ultimately earned enough to cover tuition, rent, and food. What started as a side venture quickly became something I was deeply passionate about. It didn’t feel like work. Researching new projects, protocols, and developments was something I could do all day, every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, I gained valuable experience in financial modeling, risk management, and community-driven projects. I’ve also contributed to causes I care about, such as volunteering for the National Marrow Donor Program and serving as the Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in my DeFi club at UMD. These experiences have helped shape my commitment to personal growth and making a meaningful impact.
            </p>

                I created this website for two reasons: first, to see if I could build it myself, and second, because I think it’s important for a working professional to have a personal online presence. Whether you’re interested in finance, blockchain, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
